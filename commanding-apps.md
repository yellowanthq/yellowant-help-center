# Commanding Apps

YellowAnt offers you two different ways of controlling your applications. Apart from these, the notifications and automatic updates can be configured through the dashboard and can be changed through commands and dialog boxes as well.

**Using Dialog Boxes    
**YellowAnt offers you an unique way to manage your applications from chat apps like Slack or through the native console to command applications through dialog boxes. Basically, you type in the application name, which displays a bunch of commands for you to choose from. You choose to run that command, and a dialog box pops up to take any necessary inputs that are required for the particular action.

Let's take a look at this step by step.

Step 1. Depending on the chat platform you are using YellowAnt in, you can execute commands within DMs and channels by simply typing the "appname" example "gmail" in YellowAnt DM or "@yellowant appname" example "@yellowant gmail" in a channel.

Step 2. Choose the function you would like to execute and click on "Run this command" under the chosen function.

Step 3. Fill in the required fields and hit execute.

Step 4. Your function has been executed.

For example, if you want to send an email in Gmail all you have to do is click on "run this command" for the send option and then fill in the inputs, like the person's id you are sending the mail to, what the subject is and what the body is followed by which you just hit enter and the mail is sent right from within Slack/any chat app/native console. Let's see the process below.

Step 1. Type "gmail" in YellowAnt DM or "@yellowant gmail" in a channel.

**Using simple single-line commands**

The other way of controlling your applications is through simple commands of YellowAnt. It's basically like talking to the application in a chat window. Every command is easy and has a really short learning curve for memorizing them. Well, it's not really memorizing the command because they have a particular format and a very simple approach to using them. If you know what the application does, it's extremely easy to command the application.

For example, to send an email on Gmail this is the command:  
**gmail send subject "email subject" to "recipient email id" message "email body"    
**  
So, in the above scenario, the command would be as follows:  
**gmail send subject "YellowAnt is here!" to "rohan@yellowant.com" message "Hey, check out this cool way to send an email."**

After typing this, as soon as you hit enter the email gets sent.

**Workflows - Events and Commands**

YellowAnt being an ideal platform for automation, has incredibly powerful workflows. There are two types of workflows - command-triggered and event-triggered workflows.You can either choose existing workflows from the workflows marketplace or you can create your own workflows using the workflow builder. The comprehensive documentation for how to create workflows is listed under the main documentation of YellowAnt. In this documentation, let's explore all the possible triggers and actions for every integration. We will also look into some of the combination of applications that can help you create powerful workflows.

Workflows and their execution have been explained comprehensively in the "Workflows" section of the documentation.
