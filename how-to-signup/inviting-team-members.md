# Inviting Team Members

You can also join an existing team using invitation link sent to you by a team member who already uses YellowAnt. Just click on the link and then you will need to go to your registered email account and click on “Finish Registration” in the “Complete Registration” email sent to you by YellowAnt. This will lead you to a page wherein after you fill your details and create a user id, you are ready to use YellowAnt.

Let's look at the process to invite a team member,

1. Go to the settings panel in the YellowAnt dashboard \(Read more about the Dashboard\)
