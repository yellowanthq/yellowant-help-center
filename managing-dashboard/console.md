# Console

The console is the native iterface that YellowANt provides for people who want to use it for the following purposes:

1. Use it as the command center: In case you are not on any chat platform like Slack and Microsoft Teams, you can still use YellowAnt from this console. You can command apps and execute workflows directly from here.
2. Use it as logs: No matter which chat application you are using, everything you execute and use will be logged in the console as well. You can always go here and segregate a specific application to see what has been executed for that application.

_YellowAnt Console is useful as a standalone web interface and even a logging mechanism._
