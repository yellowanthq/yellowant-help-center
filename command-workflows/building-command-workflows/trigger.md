# Command Workflow Triggers

A trigger for a command workflow is a command that triggers actions across various applications. The initiation point is when the user executes that command in the chat window or the YellowAnt native console. This means the workflow carries out the entire chain of events only if this command is executed and in no other circumstances. When you start building a workflow, you will be asked to create a command or it gets created with a default name.

If you create another one with default name, it just gets appended by a number: my-custom-workflow-name-2
