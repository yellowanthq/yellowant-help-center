# Event Workflows

YellowAnt is connected to all your apps so you can create cross application workflows that can be triggered by an event of any application. This means a certain event of a certain application can trigger a chain of events across other apps and even use the subsequent data in the process.

 In this example, a Pagerduty incident automatically creates a corresponding Jira issue.
