# Using Conditional Actions

YellowAnt, very conveniently lets you create conditional actions i.e. the workflow is dependent on various types of conditions you might use for incoming data or based on other parameters. You can use the conditional functions "FOR" and  "IF-ELSE" as an action or within input fields to create intelligent and data-driven workflows. Let's take a look at how to use conditional actions and functions.

## Using FOR as an action

The “for” function allows you to take an action for every item in a list. To use the “for” function, select it as an action when you add an action.

**list\_inputs:** This is the list which will be looped and action will be taken on every item in the list. Pick from the dynamic content that becomes available when you click in the field

**action:** This is the action that will be repeated for each item in list\_inputs. You can add this action just like an “Add Action” step
