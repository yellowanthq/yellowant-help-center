# Action

An Action is a task that is performed after the trigger command is executed. For any command workflow to work, there has to be at least one action to it. This is a very simple relationship - the trigger event acts as the stimulus for the next step i.e. the action.

Example: In this case, the trigger is the command and it results in two actions - fetch mails from a label and then also fetch Asana tasks.

Actions can occur based on conditions also, which we will cover in the next part of the documentation.
