# Using Action Outputs

One important feature while creating workflows is to use action outputs. Action outputs are the outputs of a previously added action or coming right from the trigger event itself. You can access the action outputs by using "@" in any text field in the subsequent actions.

Example:

In the trigger "incident assignment in Pagerduty", a whole lot of data is sent along with the event for us to use in the subsequent actions.

In this step, we see action outputs from Pagerduty being used to create an email body for GMail. At the same time, we can a whole lot of action outputs coming from GMail's send function as well.

In this step, we have action outs of both GMail and Pagerduty available to us for use. Also, we can see "create a task" on Asana is generating more action outputs that you can use.
