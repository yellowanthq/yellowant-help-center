# Notifications

YellowAnt also lets you receive notifications and updates on all your applications.When you sign up on YellowAnt and start integrating applications, we provide you with a default notification setting for every application, but through the console, you can configure your notifications and updates however you want them to be. This means you never have to leave a chat application like Slack to stay on top of things. In case you are not using any chat applications, you can use the YellowAnt native console to receive all your notifications in one place.

Using the YellowAnt dashboard you can simply navigate to the particular integration and change the settings for the notifications and updates. It's a very simple process and takes care of personal preferences. Here's how to do it:

1. Find the application in the Applications Panel of the Dashboard
2. Click on "Manage" on the application card 
3. Scroll down to the notifications settings
4. Toggle on/off depending on what you require for each notification
