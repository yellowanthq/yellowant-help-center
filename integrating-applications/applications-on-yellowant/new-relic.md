1. Go to your YellowAnt Dashboard \([yoursubdomain.yellowant.com](https://github.com/yellowanthq/yellowant-help-center/tree/bdad19066023aa6a8b667a1d6f05b72945b49759/yoursubdomain.yellowant.com)\) or head over to the [YellowAnt Marketplace](https://www.yellowant.com/marketplace).

2. In the search bar, look for "New Relic" or simply click the icon. If you have already integrated the application, you will be able to see it under "My Applications".
